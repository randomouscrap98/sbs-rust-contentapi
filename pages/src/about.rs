                parties involved, NO other user. We store a username you pick and your email, along with 
                a salted password hash from which you cannot reproduce the original password (standard practice). Your email 
                is not visible to anyone but you, and we only use it for password recovery and account verification. We store 
                various settings you may set for the website. We also store images you upload, which you can use as your avatar or as 
                screenshots or images for your programs and tutorials. The data is all stored on a private server which is kept 
                up to date with the latest security patches. We follow industry standard security practices for sensitive data, and
                all connections are forced to use HTTPS. There are no insecure hops between you and the server, barring a man-in-the-middle

                all your personal information, although it will make me very sad, as we'll lose valuable SBS history. Deletion is 
                permanent and cannot be undone. All images will be wiped from the server, and your user data will be purged. Pages
                and threads which you created will be turned into stubs and the original data purged, but the stub will contain
                OTHER people's comments and posts, as that data is theirs and not yours. But again, the timeframe for deletion may
